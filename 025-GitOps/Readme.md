# What The Hack - GitOps Kubernetes Hack

# Introduction
 ![](./img/image2.png)
GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools.

* **Customer needs**. 
    * Developers and Operators must integrate multiple services. 
    * Accelerate getting initial application running
    * Simplify configuration and management of advanced applications

* **Manage Kubernetes Apps at scale**. Deploy and manage Kubernetes applications across environments using DevOps techniques. Ensure that applications are deployed and configured from source control consistently.
