### Challenge
1. Install the [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo/tree/master/charts/podinfo#installing-the-chart) app using helm charts and helm cli
2. Check how configuration parameters can be passed in helm
3. Note and discuss how this is different from kubectl, pros/cons and potential challenges
4. Discuss how passing values with helm cli breaks the declarative mode of kubernetes

### Success Criteria
This challenge will be complete when your cluster has the application deployed using helm and you have some understanding of helm vs kubectl and pro/cons of helm based deployments
